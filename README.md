A repository to keep track of data science projects that I work on

## fraud-detection.ipynb
Using the credit card fraud data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), this notebook aims to develop a machine learning algorithm to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.
To overcome the large imbalance between the number of fraudulent and legitimate transactions in the data set resampling techniques are explored.

## SpaceX_Data_Science
Located in a [different repository](https://github.com/ohall1/SpaceX_Data_Science) this repository contains all of the notebooks produced as part of the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Proffesional Certificate.
